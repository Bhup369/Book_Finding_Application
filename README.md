1.For installing node modules - npm install
2.For Connecting to backend APIs we need to install axios - npm install axios
3.Run the command 'npm install react-router-dom' for implement dynamic routing 
4.then run npm start to run the application ,
5.In defining Crossorigins in Backend it is define to localhost:3000,  as in our case frontend is running on localhost:3000 .so if post is changed for your case
